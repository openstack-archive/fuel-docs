Configure an OpenStack environment on nodes with multipath block devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can deploy your OpenStack environment on servers with disks provided
by storage systems with multipath I/O.

The **advantages** of using the multipath disk configuration feature include:

* Proper discovering of multipath block devices and showing one storage
  device on server per a single multipath back-end block device.

* Mapping multipath block devices to a host operating system, Cinder LVM,
  MongoDB storage, and so on.

* Deploying an OpenStack environment with multiple multipath block devices
  attached to a single node.

* Combining a configuration of multipath block devices with the directly
  attached drives within a single node.

.. note::

   Fuel supports only multipath block devices provided by Host-Based
   Adapter (HBA).

**To configure an OpenStack environment on nodes with multipath block devices:**

#. Verify that the default bootable device meets the needs of your
   environment.

   By default, Fuel boots the first detected disk. You may need to change
   the default settings. For example, when the boot-loader is configured
   to boot from ``LUN`` other than ``LUN0``. If you need to specify
   the bootable device, complete the steps described in :ref:`select-bootable-device`.

#. If you need an additional HBA card driver to run in the environment:

   #. Log in to the Fuel Master node.
   #. Add the HBA card driver by running:

      .. code-block:: console

         fuel-bootstrap build --package <package_name> --label fc_bootstrap

      .. note::

        If the required package is not located in the preconfigured
        for bootstrap repositories, specify the required repository by passing
        the :option:`--repo 'type uri distribution [components][,priority]'`
        argument to the :command:`fuel-bootstrap build` command.

   #. Log in to the Fuel web UI.
   #. On the :guilabel:`Nodes` tab, view the disks information on receiving
      the ``new node appeared online`` notification.

      The disks` details include the paths that correspond to the underlying
      paths to the multipath block devices.

   #. Configure the IBP (image-based provisioning) images for provisioning:

      * Using the Fuel web UI:

        #. Log in to the Fuel web UI.
        #. Click the :guilabel:`Settings > Provision` tab.
        #. Specify the :guilabel:`Initial packages` to provision.

      * Using the Fuel CLI:

        #. Log in to the Fuel Master node.
        #. Download the OpenStack environment configuration file:

           .. code-block:: console

              fuel settings --env-id=<env_id> --download

        #. Open ``settings_<env_id>.yaml`` for editing.
        #. In the ``editable/provision/packages/value`` section,
           change the initial package name.

           .. note::

              If the required package is located in the repository that is not
              included in the list, add the repository details to
              ``editable/repo_setup/repos/value`` of the
              ``settings_<env_id>.yaml`` file.

        #. Upload the modified settings to Fuel:

           .. code-block:: console

             fuel settings --env-id=<env_id> --upload

#. Deploy your OpenStack environment as described in :ref:`deploy-env`.
