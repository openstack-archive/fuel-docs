Plug-in
-------

Plug-in is a software component that adds a specific
feature to an existing software application.
That means, a kind of customization is provided.

In terms of Fuel, plug-ins provide additional functionality that helps to
extend the cloud usage.

According to the functionality, plug-ins can be divided into the following categories:

* Network - adds Neutron network types

* Storage - adds Cinder and Glance storage backends

* Operations - adds monitoring and logging capabilities

* Authentication - adds Keystone back-ends, such as LDAP

For example, a Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS) plug-in for Network allows you to add network load balancing to your cloud so that incoming traffic can be spread across multiple nodes.

Mirantis provides certification procedure to check if a plug-in
meets a set of requirements.
That means, Certified are those plug-ins that are thoroughly reviewed, tested and supported by Mirantis.
Non-Certified are reviewed by Mirantis, but not supported or guaranteed to work in all cases.

All Fuel plug-ins provided by Mirantis are digitally signed for authenticity and kept in a special Catalog.

You can download the required plug-in, install it and configure.
