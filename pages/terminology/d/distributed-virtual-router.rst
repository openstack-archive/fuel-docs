Distributed Virtual Router
--------------------------

.. note:: Distributed Virtual Router (DVR) is available only with
   Neutron topology (GRE, VXLAN, VLAN configurations). Please see
   :ref:`Neutron Network Topologies <neutron-topologies-arch>`.

Distributed Virtual Router provides highly-available multi-host
routing when using :ref:`Neutron <neutron-term>`. DVR spreads the L3
agent functionality to Compute nodes, so that the inter VM traffic
does not flow to the Controller node. (East-West Routing). Such network
topology assists with network load distribution, as well as helps to
eliminate a single point of failure.

Neutron DVR also implements the Floating IP namespace (one new
namespace for all the Floating IPs per external network) on every
Compute node where the VMs are located. In this case, the VMs with
Floating IPs can forward the traffic to the external network without
reaching the Controller node. (North-South Routing).

.. note:: The term **East-West** defines network traffic between VMs
   in different subnets. And the term **North-South** defines network
   traffic between a VM and Public network.

Neutron DVR provides the legacy SNAT (Source Network Address Translation)
functionality for the default SNAT for all private VMs. SNAT service
is not distributed, it is centralized and the service node hosts the
service.
