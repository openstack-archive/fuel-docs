Preparing the Mirantis OpenStack Deployment
===========================================

Before installation, plan your deployment. Determine the deployment type that 
is appropriate for you configuration needs. You may want to print this 
list and make notes indicating your selection so you can be sure 
you have planned your deployment correctly.

The following table provides a list of configuration steps that you must 
complete to plan the Mirantis OpenStack deployment.
