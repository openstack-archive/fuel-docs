Roll back a patch
=================

You can roll back a patch by simply reinstalling your files from the backup
or, if you chose the ``-b`` option, by using the patch commands’ ``-R`` flag. Again,
please ignore the missing file errors.::

  # patch -R < /tmp/001-nova-contex.py.patch

  Perhaps you should have used the -p or --strip option?
