Plan Monitoring Facilities
==========================

Mirantis OpenStack can deploy two different
metering and montoring facilities:

- **Ceilometer** to query and store metering data
  that can be used for billing purposes

- **Zabbix** to monitor the health
  of the OpenStack services running in your environment
