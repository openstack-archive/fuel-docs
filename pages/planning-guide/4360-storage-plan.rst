Choosing the Storage Model
==========================

This section discusses considerations
for choosing the storage model for your OpenStack environment.
You need to consider two types of data:

- :ref:`Persistent storage<persistent-storage-term>`
  exists outside an instance.
- :ref:`Ephemeral storage<ephemeral-storage-term>`
  is allocated for an instance
  and is deleted when the instance is deleted.

Fuel deploys storage for two types of persistent data:

- Glance, the image storage service,
  which can use either :ref:`Swift<swift-object-storage-term>`
  or :ref:`Ceph RBD<ceph-term>` as the storage backend
- Cinder, the block storage service,
  which can use either :ref:`LVM<lvm-term>`
  or :ref:`Ceph RBD<ceph-term>` as the storage backend

The Nova compute service manages ephemeral storage.
By default, Nova stores ephemeral drives
as files on local disks on the Compute nodes
but can instead use Ceph RBD as the storage backend for ephemeral storage.

See:

- :ref:`storage-hardware-plan` for information about choosing
  the hardware to use for your storage objects
- `Storage Decisions <http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-ops/content/storage_decision.html>`_
  is an OpenStack community document
  that gives guidelines for choosing the storage model to use.
