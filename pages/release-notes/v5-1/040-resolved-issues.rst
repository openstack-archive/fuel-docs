Issues Resolved in Mirantis OpenStack 5.1 and 5.0.2
===================================================

This section lists the issues that are resolved
in both the 5.1 and 5.0.2 releases of Mirantis OpenStack.

Improvements to Verify Network
------------------------------

The underlying algorithm used for the Verify Networks feature has been modified
to make it more stable and scalable.
Specifically, these changes resolve intermittent Verify Networks failures
that occurred on heavily-loaded systems.
The network checker now generates packets in round-robin fashion
for each iface:vlan pair;
the duration is configurable, with a default value of 5 seconds.
See `LP1306705 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1306705>`_
for more details.

Upgrade now puts a new fuelclient on Master Node
------------------------------------------------

The Fuel upgrade procedure now correctly puts
a new fuelclient on the Master Node.
See `LP1346247 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1346247>`_.

Upgrade process now updates Murano database tables correctly
------------------------------------------------------------

Murano now uses Alembic migration rather than SQLAlchemy Migration,
which resolves problems
migrating Murano database tables.
See `LP1349377 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1349377>`_.

RabbitMQ management plug-in idempotency issues are resolved
------------------------------------------------------------

An idempotency issue that caused Puppet to try to enable
a management plug-in every time it ran has been resolved.
See `LP1355708 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1355708>`_.

GUID is now set correctly for Ceph journals on Ubuntu
-----------------------------------------------------

In earlier releases,
when you had two or more devices configured as Ceph disk volumes
then configured a single continuous range of disks as a Ceph journal,
only the first journal was assigned the Ceph journal GUID.
This meant that the remaining Ceph disk volumes
were not configured with the separate journal device.
GUIDs are now assigned to all Ceph journal partitions.
See `LP1355342 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1355342>`_.

Fix logging to multiple remote rsyslog servers
----------------------------------------------

Multiple inconsistencies in the syslog rotation implementation
are fixed:

- The syslog log rotation on the Fuel Master Node
  has been reimplemented to integrate docker logs with other logs,
  to add audit logs to the rotation,
  and to split client logs from server logs.
  See `LP1316957 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1316957>`_.

- Issues that caused duplicated entries in syslog
  and that prevented the log rotation scheme from clearing these logs
  could cause the logs to grow to the point
  where they filled the file system on the Fuel Master Node.
  These have been fixed.
  See `LP1329991 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1329991>`_.

- Second rsyslog server definition no longer breaks logs
  to master. See `LP1339659 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1339659>`_.

- Logs are now rotated on bootstraped nodes.
  See `LP1364083 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1364083>`_.

- Bootstrap node does not die after a week of inactivity.
  See `LP1321768 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1321768>`_.

* The `rsyslogd` restart no longer causes different services to hang.
  See `LP1363102 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1363102>`_.

syslog logging manifests are refactored
---------------------------------------

The syslog logging manifests are refactored
to use the new use_syslog_rfc_format configuration option from Oslo;
this replaces the python logging configurations
and rsyslog::imfile templates.
See `Refactor logging for puppet modules for openstack services
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/refactor-logging-puppet-openstack-services>`_.

Fuel UI now displays logs for OpenStack services
------------------------------------------------

The Fuel UI now displays logs for OpenStack services.
This is possible because of the syslog refactoring discussed above.

Use murano-db-manage to run updates
-----------------------------------

The **murano-db-manage** script is now used
to manage upgrades to the Murano database.
The **murano-manage** script is retained in the software
for backward compatibility.
See `LP1358738 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1358738>`_.

Floating IPs are created only after Keystone is ready
-----------------------------------------------------

Floating IPs are now created only after the Keystone service is fully initialized.
This resolves problems that occurred in earlier releases
when a reload of the HAProxy service
sometimes caused HAProxy to return an empty response,
which prevented the nova-floating-range provider from authenticating with Nova.
See `LP1351253 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1351253>`_
and `LP1348171 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1348171>`_.

HAProxy runs Keystone background checks only after ensuring that Keystone is initialized
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timing issues involving HAProxy Keystone background checks and backend are resolved:

- HAProxy now ensures that Keystone is initialized
  before it runs background checks that specify wait-for-keystone.
  Failure to do this resulted in intermittent Keystone authorization failures.
  See `LP1352964 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1352964>`_.

- The HAProxy Keystone backend is now configured
  before the Keystone service is initialized,
  which fixes timing issues that occurred in earlier releases
  when Keystone resources were sometimes created before Keystone was available.
  See `LP1357386 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1357386>`_.

Swift ring is sync'ed only after all Swift packages are installed
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In earlier releases, an error sometimes occurred
when Puppet tried to rsync the Swift ring files
before all Swift packages were installed.
See `LP1360118 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1360118>`_.

HAProxy now configures CFN and Cloudwatch API
---------------------------------------------

In earlier releases,
HAProxy did not configure the Heat services:
CFN and Cloudwatch API (on ports 8000 and 8003),
making them unavailable on the public endpoint.
See `LP1353358 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1353358>`_.

RabbitMQ autoheal partitions are now turned on
----------------------------------------------
RabbitMQ RabbitMQ now uses the built-in autoheal facility
to correctly manage cluster partitions.
See `LP1354319 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1354319>`_.

IP forwarding for ns_IPaddr2 resources is now enabled
-----------------------------------------------------

IP forwarding for ns_IPaddr2 resources is now set up in base system.
Without this, HAProxy running in its own namespace
could not access the external world
if net.ipv4.ip_forward == 0 was set in host system.
See `LP1342073 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1342073>`_.
and `LP1340968 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1340968>`_.


Openstack services are no longer started as soon as they are installed on Ubuntu systems
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Puppet installs the Fuel packages.
In earlier releases, the **upstart** process
then initialized the services in these packages
even though they had not yet been configured.
Earlier releases applied tweaks::ubuntu_service_override
for each package that contained a service to solve this issue.
Now, the **upstart** process waits for a service to be configured
before it starts it.
Note that this means that, if Ceph is used for volumes,
the cinder-volume override is left on its own
until **rbd.pp** configures it.
See `LP1348185 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1348185>`_.
and `LP1335804 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1335804>`_.


Neutron database is now created when deploying HA clusters
----------------------------------------------------------

In earlier releases,
the Neutron db migration scripts
were ignored when an HA cluster was deployed.
This was because the migration scripts depended on the neutron-server package,
which is installed as a dependency for the OVS server package,
so Puppet did not generate the necessary event
to trigger the syncdb process.
The migration scripts are now installed properly without a Puppet workaround.

Fuel upgrade process includes non-explicit packages
---------------------------------------------------

In earlier releases, the Fuel upgrade process
only included packages that were explicitly referenced by Puppet manifests.
Other packages were left at the older version
unless an explicit package's requirements
pulled it in as a dependency.
Fuel now uses an explicit list of packages to be upgraded.
See `LP1359705 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/mos/+bug/1359705>`_.


All packages notify service to restart after upgrade
----------------------------------------------------

All packages installed by Fuel now notify their appropriate service
to restart after they are upgraded.
See `LP1362675 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/mos/+bug/1362675>`_.


Swift is now started as a service
---------------------------------

The swift-account-replicator service is refactored
to start Swift as a service rather than through exec.
See `LP1363163 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/mos/+bug/1363163>`_.

Add hasrestart to some services
-------------------------------

Hasrestart makes Puppet use restart instead of stop
and start to manage a service and many init scripts
would behave better when restarted this way.

See `LP1364119 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/mos/+bug/1364119>`_.


Improvements for the vCenter integration
-----------------------------------------

* Deployment is completed successfully on environment with vCenter
  as hypervisor option when controller role is combined with Cinder.
  See `LP1352885 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1352885>`_.

  See `LP1352898 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1352898>`_.

* vCenter credentials are now required
  to deploy OpenStack with vCenter.
  See `LP1314613 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1314613>`_.

* Database settings have been moved
  from DEFAULT to the database section of the heat.conf file.
  The *_sql_connection* option is deprecated.
  See `LP1364026 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/mos/+bug/1364026>`_.

Issues Resolved in Mirantis OpenStack 5.1 but not 5.0.2
=======================================================

Fuel now enforces need for three MongoDB roles
----------------------------------------------

Fuel 5.0.1 installs :ref:`mongodb-term`
as a backend for :ref:`ceilometer-term`.
When installing OpenStack in HA mode,
at least three MongoDB roles must be configured;
Fuel 5.1 enforces this.
See `LP1338486 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1338486>`_.

Fuel properly enforces quorum on Controller clusters
----------------------------------------------------

Fuel now resets the **no-quorum-policy="ignore"** property
in the :ref:`crm<crm-term>` configuration
after the environment is deployed.
This property is required to incrementally add Controllers into the cluster
but not resetting it after deployment
meant that restarting the Management network
resulted in no L3 agents running on any of the nodes in the cluster.
See `LP1348548 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1348548>`_.

Diagnostic Snapshot now includes all appropriate logs
-----------------------------------------------------

The diagnostic snapshot has been modified
to capture logs in */var/log* that are only symbolic links
as well as the logs that are present in that directory.
See `LP1323436 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1323436>`_
and `LP1318514 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1318514>`_.

New Compute node can be deployed with CLI
-----------------------------------------

In earlier releases,
using the Fuel CLI to add a new Compute node to an environment
caused Puppet to run on all nodes in the environment.
Configuration information is now stored per node rather than per cluster
so that clusters can be managed seemlessly
using either the Fuel UI or the Fuel CLI.
See `LP1280318 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1280318>`_.


The unsupported_hardware option is now supported
------------------------------------------------

The CentOS distribution used with Fuel does not support some recent CPUs
such as the latest Ultra Low Voltage (ULV) line by Intel
(Core iX-4xxxU, Haswell);
newer ultralite Ultrabooks are usually equipped with such CPUs.
As a result, the Fuel Master node
(which always runs the CentOS distribution)
could not be deployed on these systems.
Controller, Compute, and Storage nodes can use these systems
but they must use the Ubuntu distribution.

Fuel 5.1 now provides the **unsupported_hardware** command line option
that disables the warning that blocked Fuel installation.
You can also use a virtualization manager,
such as QEMU or KVM, to emulate an older CPU on such systems.
Note that VirtualBox has no CPU model emulation feature.
See `LP1322502 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1322502>`_.

CentOS issues booting on some servers
-------------------------------------

Fuel can now deploy an environment on hardware
that is affected by a CentOS bug
(see `CentOS6492 <http://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=6492>`_).
Cobbler now applies appropriate kernel parameters to the deployment
to avoid these boot issues.
See `LP1312671 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1312671>`_.

Brocade and Broadcom 10gig NICs can now be configured from the Fuel UI
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Packages have been added so that the bootstrap process
can detect Brocade and Broadcom 10gig NICs,
which allows them to be configured from the Fuel UI.
In earlier releases,
brocade NICS to be included in the environment
these NICS had to be configured using the Fuel CLI.
See `LP1260492 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1260492>`_.

Glance properly sends notifications to Ceilometer
-------------------------------------------------

Modifications have been made to the notification driver
and strategy values
so that Glance now sends notifications to Ceilometer.
This means that  notifications such as "image.update" and "image.upload"
are now reported in the "ceilometer meter-list" output.
See `LP1314196 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1314196>`_.

Neutron metadata agent now uses RPC to connect to the server
------------------------------------------------------------

In earlier releases, the Neutron metadata agent used the REST API
with the python-neutronclient to connect to the Neutron server.
See `LP1364348 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1364348>`_.

Galera bugs were fixed
----------------------

* Galera sync switched to xtrabackup SST for HA deployments
  so it does not time out.
  See `LP1354479 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1354479>`_.

* Galera now reassambles on Galera quorum loss.
  See `LP1350545 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1350545>`_.

* Galera changes to config in Puppet manifests now correctly refresh MySQL service.
  See `LP1350539 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1350539>`_.

* Galera now has a declared xinetd service.
  See `LP1348863 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1348863>`_.

* While Galera node is in Sync or Donor state, many services are no longer down.
  See `LP1293680 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1293680>`_.

Pacemaker and Corosync
------------------------

* Corosync network verification item is now available to configure.
  See `LP1360018 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1360018>`_.

* Pacemaker now successfully assembles Galera cluster on Ubuntu.
  See `LP1347007 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1347007>`_.

* Pacemaker service provider no longer has a race condition.
  See `LP1355816 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1355816>`_.

Ceph can be used as a backend for ephemeral storage
-----------------------------------------------------

In previous releases,
a VM instance would not start
if Ceph was used as the backend for the ephemeral storage.
This now works,
as long as the minimal required ephemeral drive size
is explicitly specified in the flavor that is assigned to this instance.
See `LP1360000 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1360000>`_.

Fixes to Ceph deployment issues
-------------------------------

A number of Ceph deployment issues are resolved:

* Ceph module successfully sets pgp_num.
  See `LP1359321 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1359321>`_.

* Volumes are created successfully;
  no error occurs when connecting to Ceph cluster.
  See `LP1352335 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1352335>`_.

* Ceph volume now can be attached or created
  when different Cinder rbd_user and pool names are used.
  See `LP1324954 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1324954>`_.

* If Ceph is used as a backend for Glance,
  image can now be stored in rbd.
  See `LP1319106 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1319106>`_.

* Ceph deployment configuration has been fixed.
  See `LP1316524 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1316524>`_.

* Ceph deployment now successfully performs the OSD preparation step.
  See `LP1296985 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1296985>`_.

Improvements to Nova-network OCF script
---------------------------------------

* Nova-network OCF script no longer uses 'echo' for reporting errors;
  instead, it now uses 'oct_log'
  to make specifying severity of message better.
  See `LP1349504 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1349504>`_.

* Nova-network OCF script successfully counts
  configuration lines in the */etc/nova/nova.conf* file.
  See `LP1349501 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1349501>`_.

* Nova-network OCF script correctly invokes 'iptables'.
  See `LP1349484 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1349484>`_.

* Nova-network OCF script does pass '-loop' option to 'ip' command.
  See `LP1349483 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1349483>`_.

* Nova-network OCF script now properly detects 'use_ipv6' setting.
  See `LP1349432 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1349432>`_.

---------------------

* An extra RabbitMQ instance, used for message exchange between Murano and VMs,
  now starts and OS deployment finishes successfully.
  See `LP1360264 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1360264>`_.

* After primary controller is rebooted, volumes are created without getting stuck
  in creating state. See `LP1355792 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1355792>`_.
