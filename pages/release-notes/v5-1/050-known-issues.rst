Known Issues in Mirantis OpenStack 5.1
========================================

This section is under development at this time.
For current information about Issues and Blueprints
for Mirantis OpenStack 5.1, see the
`Fuel for OpenStack 5.1 Milestone <https://launchpad.net/fuel/+milestone/5.1>`_
page.

Known limitations for the vCenter integration
---------------------------------------------

The vCenter integration with Mirantis OpenStack 5.x is fully supported,
but it has some known limitations:

* vCenter integration can be enabled
  only if Nova-network is the network type.
  vCenter integration is not yet supported with the Neutron network type.

* When vCenter is selected as the hypervisor,
  all Ceph, Cinder, and Nova options are disabled
  in the storage settings.
  It is possible to use Ceph as the storage backend for Glance
  and for Swift/S3 object storage,
  but you must select it on the Fuel :ref:`Settings<settings-storage-ug>` page.
  See `LP1316377 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1316377>`_.

Known limitations for the VMware NSX integration
------------------------------------------------

The VMware NSX integration into Mirantis OpenStack 5.1 is supported,
but it has some known limitations:


* Deployment interruption (stoppage or reset) by end user or errors during
  deployment leave NSX cluster in half configured state.  User has to manually
  remove all network logical entities that were created during the unsuccessful
  deployment; otherwise, the next deployment will fail due to inability to
  register OpenvSwitches in NSX and 'br-int' bridges on nodes would not be
  configured properly, because older ones with same names exist in NSX cluster.

* If NSX cluster resides in a separate network that has L3 connectivity with
  the OpenStack Public network, you must enable Public address assignment for all
  nodes, see :ref:`neutron-nsx-arch`.


Known limitations for the Mellanox SR-IOV plug-in
-------------------------------------------------

The Mellanox :ref:`sr-iov-term` plug-in is fully integrated
into Mirantis OpenStack 5.1
but it has some known limitations:

* The Mellanox SR-IOV plugin has been tested
  against guest images of the following Linux distributions:

  - CentOS 6.4 with kernel 2.6.32-358.el6.x86
  - Ubuntu 13.10 with kernel 3.11.0-26-generic

* By default, up to 16 virtual functions (VFs) can be configured.
  To use more VFs in the compute nodes,
  you must make additional configuration changes manually
  or through a script.

* 3rd party adapters based on Mellanox chipset may not have SR-IOV enabled
  by default. In such a case, please contact the device manufacturer for
  configuration instructions and for the required firmware.

Mellanox provides additional information in their
`HowTo Install Mirantis Fuel 5.1 OpenStack with Mellanox Adapters Support
<http://community.mellanox.com/docs/DOC-1474>`_ document,
including example images to use with the Mellanox SR-IOV plugin
and advanced configuration instructions
(for example, instructions to increase the number of virtual functions).

Zabbix Issues
-------------

Phase I of Zabbix is included as an `experimental<experimental-features-term>` feature
in Mirantis OpenStack 5.1.
This version has the following known issues:

- The Zabbix-server role must be installed on a dedicated node;
  it cannot be combined with any other role.
- Phase I does not support Ceilometer, Savanna, Murano, Heat, or Ceph.
- Zabbix agents cannot be configured to report
  to a remote (outside the current environment) Zabbix server
- Zabbix agents cannot be configured to report
  to multiple Zabbix servers.

See :ref:`zabbix-plan` for more information.


Additional MongoDB roles cannot be added to an existing deployment
------------------------------------------------------------------

Fuel 5.0.1 installs :ref:`mongodb-term`
as a backend for :ref:`ceilometer-term`.
Any number of MongoDB roles (or standalone nodes)
can initially be deployed into an OpenStack environment
but, after the environment is deployed,
additional MongoDB roles cannot be added.
Be sure to deploy an adequate number of MongoDB roles
(one for each Controller node is ideal)
during the initial deployment.
See `LP1308990 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1308990>`_.

Fuel upgrade fails if custom python modules are installed as eggs
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Installing additional python modules on the Fuel Master node
using pip or easy_install
may cause the Fuel upgrade script to fail.
See `LP1341564 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1341564>`_.

Network verification fails if a node is offline
-----------------------------------------------

Network verification can fail if a node is offline
because Astute runs network verification
but Astute does not know which nodes are online..
See `LP1318659 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1318659>`_.

Multiple TestVM images may be created
-------------------------------------

Multiple TestVM images may be created
and will appear on the Horizon dashboard.
Any of the images can be used.
See `LP1342039 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1342039>`_.

"Deassociate floating IP" button may disappear from Horizon menu
----------------------------------------------------------------

The "Deassociate floating IP" button may disappear
from the Horizon menu when using Neutron network topologies.
See `LP1325575 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1325575>`_.

Some UEFI hardware cannot be used
---------------------------------

Some UEFI chips (such as the Lenovo W520)
do not emulate legacy BIOS
in a way that is compatible with the grub settings
used for the Fuel Master node.
This issue also affects servers used
as Controller, Compute, and Storage nodes;
because they are booted from PXE rom
and then the chain32 loader boots from the hard drive,
it is possible to boot them with an operating system
that is already installed,
but it is not possible to install an operating system on them
because the operating system distributions that are provided
do not include UEFI images.
See `LP1291128 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1291128>`_
and the `UEFI support blueprint <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/uefi-support>`_.

Fuel may not allocate enough IP addresses for expansion
-------------------------------------------------------

The pool of IP addresses to be used by all nodes
in the OpenStack environment
is allocated when the Fuel Master Node is initially deployed.
The IP settings cannot be changed
after the initial boot of the Fuel Master Node.
This may mean that the IP pool
is too small to support additional nodes
added to the environment
without redeploying the environment.
See `LP1271571 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1271571>`_
for a detailed description of the issues
and pointers to blueprints of proposed solutions.
See :ref:`public-floating-ips-arch`
for more information.

GRE-enabled Neutron installation runs inter VM traffic through management network
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Neutron GRE installations configured with the Fuel UI,
a single physical interface is used
for both OpenStack management traffic and VM-to-VM communications.
This limitation only affects implementations deployed using the Fuel UI;
you can use the :ref:`Fuel CLI<cli_usage>` to use other physical interfaces
when you configure your environment.
See `LP1285059 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1285059>`_.

Ubuntu does not support NetFPGA cards
-------------------------------------

CentOS includes drivers for netFPGA devices
but Ubuntu does not.
See `LP1270889 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1270889>`_.

CentOS issues using Neutron-enabled installations with VLANS
------------------------------------------------------------

Deployments using CentOS may run into problems
using Neutron VLANs or GRE
(with VLAN tags on the management, storage or public networks).
The problems include poor performance, intermittent connectivity problems,
one VLAN but not others working, or total failure to pass traffic.
This is because the CentOS kernel is based on a pre-3.3 kernel
and so has poor support for VLAN tagged packets
moving through :ref:`ovs-term`  Bridges.
Ubuntu is not affected by this issue.

A workaround is to enable VLAN Splinters in OVS.
For CentOS, the Fuel UI Settings page can now deploy
with a VLAN splinters workaround enabled in two separate modes --
soft trunks and hard trunks:

*  The **soft trunks mode** configures OVS to enable splinters
   and attempts to automatically detect in-use VLANs.
   This provides the least amount of performance overhead
   but the traffic may not be passed onto the OVS bridge in some edge cases.

*  The **hard trunks mode** also configureS OVS to enable splinters
   but uses an explicitly defined list of all VLANs across all interfaces.
   This should prevent the occasional failures associated with the soft mode
   but requires that corresponding tags be created on all of the interfaces.
   This introduces additional performance overhead.
   In the hard trunks mode,
   you should use fewer than 50 VLANs in the Neutron VLAN mode.

Fuel also provides another option here:
using the experimental ?? kernel.
This option has had minimal testing
and may invalidate your agreements with your hardware vendor.
But using this kernel may allow you to use VLAN tagged packets
without using VLAN splinters,
which can provide significant performance advantages.

See :ref:`ovs-arch`
for more information about using Open VSwitch.

Placing Ceph OSD on Controller nodes is not recommended
-------------------------------------------------------

Placing Ceph OSD on Controllers is highly discouraged because it can severely
degrade controller's performance.
It is better to use separate storage nodes
if you have enough hardware.

Controller cluster may fail if one MySQL instance fails
-------------------------------------------------------

If the MySQL instance on one Controller node fails,
the entire Controller cluster may be inaccessible
whereas it should just disable the Controller node where MySQL failed
and continue to run with the remaining Controller nodes.
See `LP1326829 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1326829>`_.

RAID-1 spans all configured disks on a node [Needs 5.1 clarification]
---------------------------------------------------------------------

RAID-1 spans all configured disks on a node,
putting a boot partition on each disk
because OpenStack does not have access to the BIOS.
It is not currently possible to exclude some drives
from the Fuel configuration on the Fuel UI.
This means that one cannot, for example,
configure some drives to be used for backup and recover
or as b-cache.

You can work around this issue as follows.
This example is for a system that has three disks: sda, sdb, and sdc.
Fuel will provision sda and sdb as RAID-1 for OpenStack
but sdc will not be used  as part of the RAID-1 array:

1. Use the Fuel CLI to obtain provisioning data:
   ::

     fuel provisioning --env-id 1 --default -d

2. Remove the drive which you do not want to be part of RAID:
   ::

     - size: 300
       type: boot
     - file_system: ext2
       mount: /boot
       name: Boot
       size: 200
       type: raid


3. Run deployment
   ::

     fuel provisioning --env-id 1 -u

4. Confirm that your partition is not included in the RAID array:
   ::

     [root@node-2 ~]# cat /proc/mdstat
     Personalities : [raid1]
     md0 : active raid1 sda3[0] sdb3[1] 204736 blocks
           super 1.0 [2/2] [UU]


See `LP1267569 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1267569>`_
and `LP1258347 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1258347>`_.
[LP1267569 is scheduled to be fixed in 5.1;
LP1258347 is scheduled to be fixed in 6.0]

LACP Bonding must be enabled in switch before deploying an environment that uses it
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Network interfaces must be connected to a switch with LACP enabled
before attempting to deploy an environment
with "LACP balance-tcp" enabled
or the deployment will fail
with many network error messages.
See `LP1370593 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1370593>`_.

Horizon and other services may be unavailable if a controller fails
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If the public NIC on the primary controller becomes unavailable,
the public VIP does not migrate to another controller.
This does not break your OpenStack environment
but services such as Horizon that use the Public VIP
become unavailable.
Bringing the affected bridge interface back online
restores access to these services.
See `LP1370510 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1370510>`_.

Deploying new controllers causes services downtime
--------------------------------------------------

When :ref:`adding controllers<add-controller-ops>`
to an existing environment,
nova-api is unavailable for a few minutes
which causes services to be unavailable.
See `LP1370067 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1370067>`_.

Environment cannot be reset to use Cinder rather than Ceph
----------------------------------------------------------

If you use Fuel to deploy a Mirantis OpenStack environment
that uses Ceph for volume, image, and ephemeral storage
then reset the environment to use Cinder rather than Ceph,
the controller node is unable to locate the HDD
and the environment cannot be redeployed.
See `LP1370006 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1370006>`_.




Other limitations
-----------------

* **The Fuel Master Node can only be installed with CentOS as the host OS.**
  While Mirantis OpenStack nodes can be installed
  with either Ubuntu or CentOS as the host OS,
  the Fuel Master Node is only supported on CentOS.

* **The floating VLAN and public networks**
  **must use the same L2 network and L3 Subnet.**
  These two networks are locked together
  and can only run via the same physical interface on the server.
  See the `Separate public and floating networks blueprint <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/separate-public-floating>`_.
  for information about ongoing work to remove this restriction.

* **The Admin(PXE) network cannot be assigned to a bonded interface.**
  When implementing bonding, at least three NICs are required:
  two for the bonding plus one for the Admin(PXE) network,
  which cannot reside on the bond and cannot be moved.
  See `LP1290513 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1290513>`_.

* **Murano requires the Neutron network type.**
  If you choose nova-network as the network type during deployment,
  the option to install the Murano project is greyed out.
  This is a design decision made by the OpenStack community;
  it allows us to focus our efforts on Neutron,
  and we see little demand for Murano support on Nova-network.

* Some OSTF tests do not give descriptive message when they fail.
  See `LP1371051 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1371051>`_.

* Deployments done through the Fuel UI
  create all of the networks on all servers
  even if they are not required by a specific role.
  For example, a Cinder node has VLANs created
  and addresses obtained from the public network.

* Some OpenStack services listen to all of the interfaces,
  a situation that may be detected and reported
  by third-party scanning tools not provided by Mirantis.
  Please discuss this issue with your security administrator
  if it is a concern for your organization.

* The provided scripts that enable Fuel
  to be automatically installed on VirtualBox
  create separate host interfaces.
  If a user associates logical networks
  with different physical interfaces on different nodes,
  it causes network connectivity issues between OpenStack components.
  Please check to see if this has happened prior to deployment
  by clicking on the “Verify Networks” button on the Networks tab.

* When configuring disks on nodes where Ubuntu has been selected as the host OS,
  the Base System partition modifications are not properly applied.
  The default Base System partition
  is applied regardless of the user choice
  due to limitations in Ubuntu provisioning.

* The Fuel Master node services (such as PostgrSQL and RabbitMQ)
  are not restricted by a firewall.
  The Fuel Master node should live in a restricted L2 network
  so this should not create a security vulnerability.

* Do not recreate the RadosGW region map after initial deployment
  of the OpenStack environment;
  this may cause the map to be corrupted so that RadosGW cannot start.
  If this happens, you can repair the RadosGW region map
  with the following command sequence:
  ::

     radosgw-admin region-map update
     service ceph-radosgw start

  See `LP1287166 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1287166>`_.

* We could improve performance significantly by upgrading
  to a later version of the CentOS distribution
  (using the 3.10 kernel or later).
  See `LP1322641 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1322641>`_.

* Docker loads images very slowly on the Fuel Master Node.
  See `LP1333458 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1333458>`_.
