Support for Operating System (base-os) role
-------------------------------------------

With Fuel 6.1 you are now able to deploy an empty role that you can then
customize to fit your needs.

See `Blueprint: Allow generic linux install with no additional packages...
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/blank-role-node>`_.

For detailed instructions on how to deploy an empty role
through Fuel CLI see :ref:`Deploying an empty role <empty-role>`.
