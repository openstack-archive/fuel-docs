VMware Settings tab on the Fuel web UI
--------------------------------------

Previously, VMware settings were included into
Settings tab of the Fuel web UI alongside with other configuration
options.
Fuel 6.1 provides a separate VMware tab of the Fuel web UI:
now it is possible to have and add different vSphere clusters for nova-compute
and Cinder or Glance services.
For instructions, see :ref:`VMware tab <vmware-tab>`.
