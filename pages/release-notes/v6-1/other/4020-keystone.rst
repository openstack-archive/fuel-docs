* The eventlet monkeypatching now precedes the logging system
  initialization. Previously, it occurred after the logging system
  initialization, thus leaving all the locks used in the
  logging handlers non-patched and breaking ``threading.RLock``.
  The initialization order is fixed, so eventlet locks work
  correctly. See `LP1413341`_.
