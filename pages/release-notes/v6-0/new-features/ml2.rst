Fuel uses ML2 plugins rather than Neutron plugins
-------------------------------------------------

Fuel 6.0 extends the support for ML2 plugins that was introduced in Fuel 5.1;
support for Neutron plugins has been removed from Juno. ML2 plugin packages
can be developed without modifying the Fuel core, which simplifies the vendor
development process and allows plugins to be interchanged more easily. See the
`Neutron ML2 plugin support for Fuel
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/ml2-neutron>`_ blueprint for
implementation details.
