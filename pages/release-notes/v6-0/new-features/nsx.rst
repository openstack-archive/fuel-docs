Support for vCenter with NSX
----------------------------

Fuel 6.0 can deploy an environment that uses both :ref:`vCenter<vcenter-term>`
as a hypervisor and :ref:`NSX<nsx-term>` as a networking option. See the
`Integration of NSX with vCenter
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/vcenter-nsx-support>`_ blueprint
for implementation details.
