Known Issues in 6.0
-------------------

Deploying new controllers causes services downtime
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When :ref:`adding controllers<add-controller-ops>`
to an existing environment,
nova-api is unavailable for a few minutes,
which causes services to be unavailable.
See `LP1370067 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1370067>`_.

Enabling Murano may prevent the controller from redeploying
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When Murano is deployed on CentOS, redeployment of the controller might fail.
