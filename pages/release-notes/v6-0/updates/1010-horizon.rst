OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon)

Resolved Issues

* Horizon login page no longer contains a DoS
  vulnerability (CVE-2014-8124). Previously,
  it used to handle session records improperly by accessing
  a session too early in the login process. That resulted in
  the creation of session records in a session back end, and
  was especially problematic when using non-cookie back ends.
