Deployment with Ubuntu 14.04 bootstrap
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can now deploy an OpenStack environment using the Ubuntu 14.04
bootstrap. However, currently this functionality is suitable for
:ref:`experimental or testing purposes only <experimental-features-term>`.
We do not recommend applying Ubuntu 14.04 bootstrap if you use
bare-metal nodes on big OpenStack environments and/or if your
deployment automation relies on a persistent naming of network devices
during the deployment process.

Because Ubuntu 14.04 bootstrap uses asynchronous device
initialization, the naming of devices (in particular, network
interfaces) is not guaranteed to be persistent. If you re-install
Ubuntu 14.04 bootstrap on the same node, devices may randomly
switch names, depending on what device boots first. This only affects
bare-metal nodes, since NICs on virtual nodes have constant
initialization time. See `LP1487044`_.

If you deploy an environment that uses bare-metal nodes with Ubuntu
14.04 bootstrap, check each node and manually reassign the networks
to the correct interfaces.
