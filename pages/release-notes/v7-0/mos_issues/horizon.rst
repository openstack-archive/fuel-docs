* An authenticated user may conduct a persistent XSS attack by
  setting a malicious metadata to a Glance image, a Nova flavor, or a
  Host Aggregate, and tricking an administrator to load the update
  metadata page. Once executed in a legitimate context, this attack
  may result in a privilege escalation. To fix this, the metadata is
  omitted and then is interpreted as JSON. See `LP1468744`_.
