What is Mirantis OpenStack?
===========================

Mirantis OpenStack is made up of three components:

* Fuel for OpenStack
* Mirantis OpenStack hardened packages
* Mirantis Support

Fuel for OpenStack
------------------

Fuel is a lifecycle management application that deploys multiple OpenStack
clouds from a single interface and then enables you to manage those clouds post
deployment. You can add nodes, remove nodes, or even remove clouds, restoring
those resources to the available resources pool. Fuel also eases the
complexities of network and storage configurations through a simple-to-use
graphical user experience. Baked into Fuel are:

* Mirantis reference architectures that we've tested and certified to ensure
  that your deployed clouds are scalable, reliable, and production quality.
* An open and flexible library that enables customers to make configuration
  changes that may be more advanced or focused than the default choices within
  Fuel. This library also empowers organizations to fold additional drivers or
  integrations into the deployed environment.

Mirantis OpenStack hardened packages
------------------------------------

These packages include the core OpenStack projects, updated with each stable
release of OpenStack. Also included are:

* Packages to ensure High Availability.
* Any defect fixes reported by our customers that may not yet have been merged into the community source.
* Mirantis-driven premium OpenStack projects (for example, Savanna and Murano).
* Mirantis-certified partner plug-ins, drivers, and integrations.

Another benefit you get from Mirantis OpenStack, compared with some competitors,
is our broad support for operating systems, hypervisors, and deployment topologies.
We don't restrict your choices to one OS or one hypervisor type. In addition, you
can choose the OpenStack roles you want on each available node.

Mirantis Support
----------------

Further, Mirantis OpenStack offers a subscription to our world-class support
with defined service level agreements based on the severity of your issue.
For example, the premium support guarantees a one-hour response for severity 1 issues.
