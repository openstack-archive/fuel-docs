IPMI
----

**IPMI** is a `standard`_ driven by Intel that has been widely adopted by
the server manufacturers. It provides hardware **Sensors Data Records**
to collect information such as:

* Components temperature
* Fan rotation
* Components voltage
* Power supply status (redundancy check)
* Power status (on or off)

The IPMI **System Event Log** provides a timed journal of all events that occurred
in the server. Each threshold crossing of previous sensors is logged with a severity
level that can be one of the following: recoverable, non-critical, critical, unrecoverable.
See the `IPMI specifications`_ for further details.

Other events can also be logged, such as:

* Memory Error-Correcting-Code memory (ECC) detection that can be reported in an
  alert if they happen too often.

* Chassis intrusion detections that can be reported in an alert for security reasons.

Most Linux distributions provide the ``ipmitool`` package that allows to interact with
the IPMI interface.

Retrieve the SDR records for voltage by running::

  # /usr/bin/ipmitool -I lan -L operator -U root -H <ip> \
  -P <password> sdr type "Voltage" list

   When coupled with the Ironic project, Ceilometer
   has the ability to collect `IPMI sensors`_.
