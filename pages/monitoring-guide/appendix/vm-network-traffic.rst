VM Network Traffic
------------------

The traffic across VMs can be monitored from the virtual
switches by enabling monitoring sampling with `sFlow`_ on
each Open vSwitch server.

The basic principle is to sample network traffic and send
all the samples to the `sFlow collector`_ for analysis.
Known open source software that supports sFlow include `pmacct`_,
`Ganglia`_, and `Ntop`_.

NetFlow is a commercial standard embedded in many physical
devices with the main difference that it does not sampling
network traffic, which is more resource-intensive than sFlow
but also more accurate.
