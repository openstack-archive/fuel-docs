Sahara
------

Sahara is the OpenStack Data processing service. Sahara performs two
types of activities in OpenStack:

* Hadoop cluster provisioning
* Executing Elastic Data Processing (EDP) jobs

Sahara runs as a single process service on each controller in MOS
6.x. This, however, will change in MOS 7.x.

**API checks**

Check the proper functioning of the API with a read operation. For
example:

* list provisioning plugins

  * GET /v1.1/<tenant-id>/plugins

   * - Metrics
     - Source
     - Purpose

   * - Total number of Sahara clusters in ``Active`` state
     - poll SQL:

       select count(*) from clusters where status="Active";
     - diag

   * - Total number of Sahara clusters in ``Error`` state
     - poll SQL:

       select count(*) from clusters where status="Error";
     - Alert:

       Too many clusters in ``Error`` state may be a sign of the
       provisioning engine failure or failures in other OpenStack
       services.

   * - Total number of Sahara clusters doing provisioning at the
       moment
     - poll SQL:

       select count(*) from clusters where status not in ("Active",
       "Error");
     - Alert:

       Too many clusters in provisioning state may be a sign of a
       slow network throughput or even missing network connectivity
       between VMs.

       It may also be a sign of a corrupted image being used for the
       clusters.

   * - Total number of VMs used in Sahara clusters
     - poll SQL

       select count(*) from instances;
     - diag

   * - Total number of Cinder Volumes attached to Sahara VMs
     - poll SQL (cross project)

       select count(*) from cinder.volumes where instance_uuid in
       (select instance_id from sahara.instances) and
       attach_status="attached";
     - diag

   * - Total number of Security Group Rules generated by Sahara
     - poll SQL (neutron)

       select count(*) from neutron.securitygrouprules where
       security_group_id in (select id from neutron.securitygroups
       where description LIKE "%Auto security group created by
       Sahara%");
     - diag

   * - Total number of Floating IPs attached to Sahara VMs
     - poll SQL:

       select count(*) from instances where management_ip is not
       NULL;
     - diag

   * - Total number of Glance Images uploaded for Sahara clusters
     - poll SQL (glance):

       select count(*) from glance.image_properties where
       name="_sahara_username" and deleted=0;

       Too many errors in EDP may be a sign of deeper problems.
