MySQL
-----

The MySQL database running on the OpenStack controller nodes is a
central component because it is used by almost all the OpenStack
components as their primary data persistence storage. Therefore, it
is critical to monitor the healthiness of this component on each
of the controller nodes in the cluster.

**Process checks**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 20 20 20
   :stub-columns: 0
   :class: borderless

   * - Process name
     - Incoming connections
     - Role
     - Dependencies
     - HA mode

   * - mysqld
     - TCP 3306
     - controller
     - storage
     - active/passive

In addition to checking the existence of the process, it is necessary
to check the availability status of the MySQL database. This can be
verified using the command::

  # mysqladmin ping


| **Collected Metrics**


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 20
   :stub-columns: 0
   :class: borderless

   * - Metrics
     - Source
     - Purpose

   * - bytes received (bytes/sec)
     - :ref:`poll SQL <poll_SQL>`
     - diag

   * - bytes sent (bytes/sec)
     - :ref:`poll SQL <poll_SQL>`
     - diag

   * - begin operations
     - :ref:`poll SQL <poll_SQL>`
     - diag

   * - commit operations
     - :ref:`poll SQL <poll_SQL>`
     - diag

   * - delete operations
     - :ref:`poll SQL <poll_SQL>`
     - diag

   * - insert operations
     - :ref:`poll SQL <poll_SQL>`
     - diag

   * - rollback operations
     - :ref:`poll SQL <poll_SQL>`
     - diag

   * - select operations
     - :ref:`poll SQL <poll_SQL>`
     - Alert:
       The absence of select operations could indicate that
       the connection to the database is broken unless the MySQL
       server is in maintenance.

   * - update operations
     - :ref:`poll SQL <poll_SQL>`
     - diag

   * - number of queries
     - :ref:`poll SQL <poll_SQL>`
     - :ref:`diag <diag>`

   * - slow queries
     - :ref:`poll SQL <poll_SQL>`
     - diag

   * - Database physical size (Mbyte)
     - poll SQL:

       SELECT table_schema "database", sum( data_length +
       index_length ) / 1024 / 1024 "size_mb" FROM
       information_schema.TABLES GROUP BY table_schema order by 2
       desc;
     - diag

.. _poll_SQL:

These poll SQL metrics can be collected using the following SQL command::

  SHOW GLOBAL STATUS WHERE Variable_name=<NAME>;

See MySQL `server status variables`_ for details.

.. _diag:

.. note::

   You should pay attention to MySQL logs to detect slow queries
   for diagnostic purposes. You can activate slow queries log with
   the following configuration parameters:
   ``slow_query_log=1``, ``long_query_time=5``, and
   ``slow_query_log_file=<filename>``.


| **Metrics related to the MySQL cluster**

The high availability of the MySQL database is supported in
active/passive mode with one master and several slave nodes.
To ensure that the MySQL cluster remains highly available, you should
continuously monitor that slave nodes are ready to take over in case
of a master node failure.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 20
   :stub-columns: 0
   :class: borderless

   * - Metrics
     - Source
     - Purpose

   * - wsrep_ready
     - :ref:`SQL <SQL>` possible values: ``ON``/``OFF``
     - Alert: node not ready if ``OFF``

   * - wsrep_cluster_size
     - :ref:`SQL: <SQL>` number of nodes
     - diag

   * - wsrep_replicated_bytes
     - :ref:`SQL: <SQL>` bytes sent to other nodes
     - diag

   * - wsrep_received_bytes
     - :ref:`SQL: <SQL>` bytes received from other nodes
     - diag

   * - wsrep_cluster_status
     - :ref:`SQL: <SQL>`  Primary/Non- Primary/Disconnected
     - Alert: A node is disconnected from the cluster.

   * - wsrep_local_commits
     - :ref:`SQL <SQL>` number of commit
     - diag

   * - errors
     - ``/var/log/mysqld.log``
     - Alert: When a sudden spike of errors is detected.

.. _SQL:

These metrics can be collected with the SQL command::

  SHOW STATUS WHERE Variable_name REGEXP 'wsrep.*';
