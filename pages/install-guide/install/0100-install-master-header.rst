Fuel is distributed via an ISO image, which contains an installer for
Fuel Master node. The ISO image is used for CD media devices, iLO (HP) or
similar remote access systems.

Once installed, Fuel can be used to deploy and manage OpenStack environments.
It will assign IP addresses to the nodes, perform PXE boot and initial
configuration, and provision of OpenStack nodes according to their roles in
the environment.
