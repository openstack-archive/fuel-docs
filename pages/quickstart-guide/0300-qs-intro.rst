Introduction
============

Fuel is a deployment tool that simplifies installation of Mirantis
OpenStack (MOS).
For testing, install Fuel on VirtualBox and use it to deploy the
Mirantis OpenStack environment.
You have the following options to deploy Fuel and the Mirantis OpenStack:

* **Automated installation using the Mirantis VirtualBox scripts**
  When you install Mirantis OpenStack using the Mirantis VirtualBox
  scripts, you do not need to configure the virtual machine network
  and hardware settings. The script provisions the virtual machines
  with all required settings automatically. However, you must place
  the latest Mirantis OpenStack ISO image in the ``iso`` directory. 
  You may also modify the number of Fuel Slave Nodes using the 
  ``config.sh`` script.

* **Manual Installation**
  When installing manually, you need to configure the virtual machine
  settings according to the hardware and network prerequisites.
  Use manual installation only if you cannot run the Mirantis
  VirtualBox scripts for some technical or business reasons.
