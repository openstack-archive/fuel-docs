Applying patches
================

Introduction
------------

This section describes how to apply and roll back the patches to a Fuel
Master node and Fuel Slave nodes.

Patching in brief:

* The patching feature is introduced in Mirantis OpenStack 6.1
  and will not work in older releases.
* You can always check what patches are available and get instructions
  on how to apply them in the
  `Maintenance Updates section of the Release Notes <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-6.1/release-notes.html#maintenance-updates>`_.
* There are two types of patches: bugfixes and security updates.
* Patches are downloaded from the Mirantis public repositories.
* The changes that the patches introduce will be applied to the redeployed
  and new OpenStack environments as well.

Usage scenarios
---------------

Default scenario
++++++++++++++++

In the default scenario, you download patches from the default Mirantis
mirrors.

* The documentation is always available in the
  `Maintenance Updates section of the Release Notes <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-6.1/release-notes.html#maintenance-updates>`_.
* Your repositories by default are configured to download the patches from
  Mirantis. The patching repositories are:

  .. image:: /_images/patchingReposOps.png

* Check each patching item and proceed with the instructions (plan
  accordingly: for example, schedule a maintenance slot to run the
  update).

  * Patching a Fuel Master node:

    #. Run the command specified in the documentation to install the patch.
    #. After the patch is installed, restart the affected service as
       specified in the documentation.

  * Patching a Fuel Slave node running Ubuntu or CentOS:

    #. Run the command specified in the documentation to download the patch.
    #. Run the command specified in the documentation to install the patch.

Custom scenario: deploying from local mirrors; patching from local mirrors
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this custom scenario, you deploy from your local mirrors and download
patches from your local mirrors.

For information on how to create and update local mirrors of Mirantis
OpenStack, see :ref:`Configuring repositories<configuring-repos-ops>`.

* The documentation is always available in the
  `Maintenance Updates section of the Release Notes <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-6.1/release-notes.html#maintenance-updates>`_.
* Check each item and proceed with the instructions described in the
  documentation (plan accordingly).

  * Patching a Fuel Master node:

    #. Verify that your local mirror is up-to-date: run
       :command:`fuel-createmirror -M`.
    #. Run the command specified in the documentation to download the patch.
    #. Run the command specified in the documentation to install the patch.
    #. After the patch is installed, restart the affected service(s) if
       needed, as specified in the documentation.

  * Patching a Fuel Slave node running Ubuntu or CentOS:

    #. Run the command specified in the documentation to download the patch.
    #. Run the command specified in the documentation to install the patch.

Custom scenario: deploying from Mirantis mirrors; patching from local mirrors
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this custom scenario, you deploy from Mirantis mirrors and download
patches from your local mirrors.

* Configure your local mirrors to download patches from Mirantis
  mirrors as described in :ref:`Configuring repositories<configuring-repos-ops>`.
* The documentation is always available in the
  `Maintenance Updates section of the Release Notes <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-6.1/release-notes.html#maintenance-updates>`_.
* Check each item and proceed with the instructions described in the
  documentation (plan accordingly).

  * Patching a Fuel Master node:

    #. Verify that your local mirror is up-to-date: run
       :command:`fuel-createmirror -M`.
    #. Run the command specified in the documentation to download the patch.
    #. Run the command specified in the documentation to install the patch.
    #. After the patch is installed, restart the affected service as
       specified in the documentation.

  * Patching a Fuel Slave node running Ubuntu or CentOS:

    #. Run the command specified in the documentation to download the patch.
    #. Run the command specified in the documentation to install the patch.

**Rolling back patches**

.. note::
   Use the instructions listed here only for Mirantis OpenStack 6.1.

.. note::
   The rollback instructions listed here are for advanced administrators.
   If you are not sure how to plan and execute the rollbacks,
   your best option is to contact `Mirantis support <https://www.mirantis.com/services/enterprise-support-services/>`__.

**Rolling back a Fuel Master node**

#. Roll back the packages on a Fuel Master node.
   `Refer to this article <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/64069>`__ as
   an example.
#. Roll back all the changes to the configuration you made when applying
   the patching instructions.
#. Run :command:`dockerctl destroy all`.
#. Run :command:`dockerctl start all`.
#. Wait for bootstrap to complete.

**Rolling back a CentOS-based Fuel Slave node**

#. Evacuate all the running resources from the node.
#. Verify that new workloads are not scheduled to the node: put nova
   services in maintenance, turn on Pacemaker into maintenance mode, and so on.
#. Install packages with specific versions::

    yum list all <component name or part of the name like kernel>

    yum downgrade <pkgname><pkg version>

#. Roll back the packages on the node.
   `Refer to this article <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/64069>`__ as
   an example.
#. Roll back all the changes to the configuration you made when applying
   the patching instructions.
#. Reboot the node.

**Rolling back a Ubuntu-based Fuel Slave node**

#. Evacuate all the running resources from the node.
#. Verify that new workloads are not scheduled to the node: put nova
   services in maintenance, turn on Pacemaker into maintenance mode, and so on.
#. Find the packages you want to roll back in `/var/log/apt/history.log`
   and `/var/log/dpkg.log`.
#. Figure out where to get the old package version. Run
   :command:`apt-cache policy`.
#. Figure out if the old package version is available locally. If it is,
   install these versions using dpkg. Otherwise, check the snapshots of
   previous repositories at http://mirror.fuel-infra.org/mos/snapshots and
   pick the repository that contains the packages you need.
#. Add this repository to the environment configuration.
#. On the Fuel Master node, run::

    fuel node --node-id <comma_separated_list_of_nodes_you_want_to_update_repo>
    --tasks upload_core_repos

   This will propagate the new repository configuration.

#. Install the packages with specific versions::

    apt-get install <pkg1>=<ver1> <pkg2>=<ver2>

#. Roll back all the changes to the configuration you made when applying
   the patching instructions.
#. Reboot the node.


**Applying all accumulated changes in one go**

.. warning::
   This set of actions should be applied carefully and with
   consideration. We strongly recommend that you do this on your
   test staging environment before applying the updates to production.

It is a good practice to apply the updates node by node so that you can
stop the update procedure whenever an issue occurs. It is also
strongly recommended to back up all sensitive data that can be altered
continuously during the whole lifetime of your environment and
the Fuel Master node.

These instructions assume that if you add any custom repositories to
your environment configuration, these commands will update your
environment taking packages from these repositories.

**Patching a Fuel Master node**

#. Back up your data with :command:`dockerctl` backup. This will save the data
   to `/var/backup/fuel/`.
#. Run :command:`yum update`.
#. Run :command:`dockerctl destroy all`.
#. Run :command:`dockerctl start all`.
#. Wait for the new containers deployment to finish.

**Patching a Ubuntu-based Fuel Slave node**

#. Run :command:`apt-get update`.
#. Run :command:`apt-get upgrade`.
#. Apply all the additional configuration options as described in the
   supporting documentation.
#. Reboot the node.

**Patching a CentOS-based Fuel Slave node**

#. Run :command:`yum update`.
#. Apply all the additional configuration options as described in the
   supporting documentation.
#. Reboot the node.


**Does installing a new environment come with all the latest updates?**

Yes, installing a new environment comes with all the latest updates.
