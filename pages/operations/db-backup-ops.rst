OpenStack Database Backup and Restore with Percona XtraBackup
=============================================================

With the procedure described in this topic
you will be able to back up and restore
your OpenStack MySQL database.

You will need to put the OpenStack
environment into maintenance mode.

In the maintenance mode the following services
will be unavailable:

 * MySQL and HAProxy on the selected controller node
 * HAProxy on other controller nodes in the cluster for a short time

Backing up with Percona XtraBackup
----------------------------------

#. Enable the HAProxy stats socket for every controller in a cluster:

  #. Open the */etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg* file for editing.

  #. Find the *stats socket /var/lib/haproxy/stats* line in the global section
     and add *level admin* at the end of the line.

#. Restart HAProxy in one of the following ways:

   * Execute /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/mirantis/ns_haproxy reload on every controller

   Or

   * Reload all HAProxy instances on all controllers in a cluster with a temporary
     services stop by running the *crm resource restart p_haproxy* command.

#. On the Fuel Master node, run the *fuel nodes | grep controller* command.
   If the node that you are going to back up is a host for a Neutron agent,
   you can move the agent to a different controller with the following command:

   ::

     ssh node-1
     pcs resource move agent_name node_name

   where "node-1" is the name of the node from which you would like to move.

#. For every controller in the cluster, put the MySQL service into
   maintenance mode by running the following command from the Fuel Master node:

   ::

     ssh -t node-1 'echo "disable server mysqld/node-1" | socat stdio /var/lib/haproxy/stats'

#. Put the node into maintenance mode for Pacemaker:

   ::

     ssh node-1
     crm node maintenance

   where "node-1" is the name of the node from which you would like to move.

#. Stop data replication on the selected MySQL instance:

   ::

     mysql -e "SET GLOBAL wsrep_on=off;"

#. Run the backup:

   ::

     xtrabackup --backup --stream=tar ./ | gzip - > backup.tar.gz

#. Make a streaming backup as described in
   `Percona Guide <http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.1/howtos/recipes_ibkx_stream.html>`_.

#. Move the archive file to a safe place.

#. Re-enable the data replication:

   ::

     mysql -e "SET GLOBAL wsrep_on=on;"

#. Take the MySQL service out of maintenance mode with
   the following command for every controller in the cluster:

   ::

     ssh -t node-1 'echo "enable server mysqld/node-1" | socat stdio /var/lib/haproxy/stats'

#. Put the node into the ready mode:

   ::

     ssh -t node-1 crm node ready

   where "node-1" is the node that you have backed up.

Restoring with Percona XtraBackup
---------------------------------

#. Remove grastate.dat (e.g. move to a different place) оn all nodes:

   ::

     ssh node-1 mv /var/lib/mysql/grastate.dat /var/lib/mysql/grastate.old
     ssh node-2 mv /var/lib/mysql/grastate.dat /var/lib/mysql/grastate.old
     ssh node-3 mv /var/lib/mysql/grastate.dat /var/lib/mysql/grastate.old

#. Extract the database backup file on the first controller:

   ::

     ssh node-1 'cd /var/lib/mysql/ ;tar -xvzf clear-base.tgz'

   where "node-1" is the node that you have backed up.

#. Change the owner:

   ::

     chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql

#. Export the variables for *mysql-wss* on all nodes:

   ::

     export OCF_RESOURCE_INSTANCE=p_mysql
     export OCF_ROOT=/usr/lib/ocf
     export OCF_RESKEY_socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

#. Export the variable for *mysql-wss on* the first node:

   ::

     export OCF_RESKEY_additional_parameters="--wsrep-new-cluster"

#. Start *mysqld* on the first controller:

   ::

     /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/mirantis/mysql-wss start

#. Start *mysqld* on all other controllers:

   ::

     /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/mirantis/mysql-wss start

#. Copy the extracted database backup.

#. Check the crm status for all nodes.
