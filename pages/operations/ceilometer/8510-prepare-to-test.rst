Preparing Ceilometer for Testing
--------------------------------

The Platform Tests that are run as a part of the Health Tests
test Ceilometer if the Environment is configured accordingly.
Before running the test,
please read the requirements below.

Note that the tests are run in the tenant
that you specify in the `OpenStack Settings` tab
during the OpenStack installation.
By default, the `admin` tenant is used for the tests.

To run Ceilometer Platform Tests, you must have at least 6 GB
of RAM on each controller node.

To run the "Ceilometer test to check notifications from Sahara" test,
you must have at least 4096 MB of available RAM in the tenant
you are using for the Ceilometer Platform Tests, otherwise the test may fail.
Also you must get an image with Hadoop for Sahara
and register it with Sahara. For instructions,
see the `Sahara deployment (Preparing Sahara for Testing)
<https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-6.1/operations.html#preparing-sahara-for-testing>`_.

To run the "Ceilometer test to check notifications from Nova" test,
you must have at least 100 MB of available RAM in the tenant
you are using for the Ceilometer Platform Tests, otherwise the test may fail.

If the requirements above are satisfied, Ceilometer is ready
to be tested.
