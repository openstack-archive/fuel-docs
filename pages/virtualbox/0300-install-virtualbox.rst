Introduction
============

You can install Fuel on VirtualBox
and use that to deploy a Mirantis OpenStack environment
for demonstration and evaluation purposes.
Mirantis provides scripts that create and configure
all the VMs required for a test environment,
including the Master node and Slave nodes.
See the `Quick Start Guide <http://software.mirantis.com/quick-start/>`_
for links and instructions.

This guide provides additional information
about running Fuel and Mirantis OpenStack on VirtualBox.

The requirements for running Fuel on VirtualBox are:

  A host machine with Linux, Windows or Mac OS. We recommend 64-bit host OS.
  The scripts have been tested on Mac OS 10.7.5, Mac OS 10.8.3, Ubuntu 12.04,
  Ubuntu 12.10, Fedora 19, OpenSUSE 12.2/12.3, and Windows 7 x64 + Cygwin_x64.

VirtualBox 4.2.16 (or later) is required, along with the extension pack.
Both can be downloaded from `<http://www.virtualbox.org/>`_.

.. note::

  To run these scripts on Windows directly,
  you must first install Cygwin on your system;
  see the `Cygwin installation page <http://www.cygwin.com/install.html>`_.
  You can also manually create the VMs to use for Fuel and the Slave nodes.

  You need to install the **expect**, **openssh**,
  **ping** and **procps** packages,
  which do not install by default.
  Use the "-P expect,openssh,ping,procps" option to install these; for example:

  ::

     setup-x86_64.exe -a x86_64  -P expect,openssh,ping,procps --quiet-mode \
        --site http://box-soft.com/


8 GB+ of RAM
  Supports 4 VMs for Multi-node OpenStack installation
  (1 Master node, 1 Controller node, 1 Compute node, 1 Cinder node).
  The size of each VM should be reduced to 1536 MB RAM.
  For dedicated Cinder node, 768 MB of RAM is enough.

  or

  Supports 5 VMs for Multi-node with HA OpenStack installation
  (1 Master node, 3 combined Controller + Cinder nodes, 1 Compute node).
  The size of each VM should be reduced to 1280 MB RAM.
  This is less that the recommended amount of RAM amount per node
  for HA configurations (2048+ MB per controller)
  and may lead to unwanted issues.


Issue with some Linux distributions
-----------------------------------

In some of Linux distributions (at least in Fedora 20), you may encounter
an issue with the NetworkManager service interfering with VirtualBox host-only
network functionality.

NetworkManager service may interfere with VirtualBox IP addresses assigned
for host-only adapters and remove the IP addresses after DHCP timeout. This
may lead to different problems: for example, it will be impossible
to deploy an HA environment.

To avoid the problem, follow these steps:

#. Make sure the the initial installation of Fuel is completed.

#. Add the **NM_CONTROLLED=no** line at the beginning of all
   vboxnet interface configuration files.
   These files may be called differently, depending on
   your Linux distribution or configuration.
   Example:

   ::

      [user@system]$ ls -l /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*
      -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 254 Jan 14  2014 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-lo
      -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 178 Feb 13 12:01 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-p2p1
      -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 242 Feb 16 12:14 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-Wired_connection_1
      -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 242 Feb 16 12:14 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-Wired_connection_2
      -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 242 Feb 16 12:14 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-Wired_connection_3

   Here, files **Wired_connection_1** through **Wired_connection_3** are the files
   that configure vboxnet interfaces and should be edited with the *NM_CONTROLLED=no** line.

#. Stop all VMs in VirtualBox.

#. Reboot the host.

#. Start the VMs.

#. Proceed with environment creation.
