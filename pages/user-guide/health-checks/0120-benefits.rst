Benefits
--------

* Using post-deployment checks helps you identify potential issues which
  may impact the health of a deployed system.

* All post-deployment checks provide detailed descriptions about failed
  operations and tell you which component or components are not working
  properly.

* Previously, performing these checks manually would have consumed a
  great deal of time. Now, with these checks the process will take only a
  few minutes.

* Aside from verifying that everything is working correctly, the process
  will also determine how quickly your system works.

* Post-deployment checks continue to be useful, for example after
  sizable changes are made in the system you can use the checks to
  determine if any new failure points have been introduced.
