that have been discovered in your environment.
And the ratio of unallocated to total nodes is shown in the top right
of the page.

You can review your nodes on the "Nodes" tab. Here you you can
also manage, sort, filter the list of nodes, as well as look for
a specific node by its name, MAC, or IP address:

It is not possible to have two labels with the same name but different
values. Label names must be unique.
