Boot the Fuel Master Node
=========================

When installation is complete,
**be sure to remove the installation media** from your system.
This is especially important if you set the boot order
so that the USB/DVD drive is before the hard disk;
you may accidentally boot the installation media again
and damage or delete your environment.

The boot messages display on your screen as Fuel boots up:

When the system has booted,
use the URL, administrator login name and password
that are displayed on the boot screen.
The default URL is http://10.20.0.2:8000/.
This is your URL unless you modified the IP address
during installation.

Alternately, if the server on which the Fuel Master is installed
has more than one NIC,
you can use the second NIC to access the Fuel web interface:

- Connect the NIC to the appropriate switch
- Set the IP address for this NIC
- Use the IP address you set to access the Fuel UI.

Note that doing this does not change the  Admin network settings;
the URL displayed on the Fuel boot screen is unchanged and can still be used.
