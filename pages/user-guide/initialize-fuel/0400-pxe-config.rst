Changing PXE Network Parameters During Installation
---------------------------------------------------

You may need to customize the network settings for the Admin
(PXE) logical network.
To do this, press the <TAB> key on the very first installation screen
(the one that says "Welcome to Fuel Installer!")
and update the kernel option ``showmenu=no`` to ``showmenu=yes``.
Alternatively, you can press a key to start Fuel Setup
during the first boot after installation.

By default, `eth0` on the Fuel Master node listens to PXE requests
from the Fuel Admin (PXE booting) network, which has a default
network of ``10.20.0.2/24`` and the gateway ``10.20.0.1``.
Note that,

- Changing the IP address here
  also changes the CIDR for the Admin network.
- Changing the IP address on the Admin network interface
  requires changes to the DHCP range values
  in the PXE Settings screen.
- New default DHCP values that fit into this range are auto-populated,
  but be sure that the range does not conflict
  with other devices on the network.

The console-based Fuel Setup allows you to customize the Admin (PXE)
logical network if you want to use a different network interface.
See :ref:`logical-networks-arch` for more information about
the Admin (PXE) logical network.

Within Fuel Setup, you can configure the following:

* DHCP/Static configuration for each network interface
* Select interface for Fuel Admin network
* Define DHCP pool (bootstrap) and static range (installed nodes)
* Root password
* DNS options

This tool provides a simple way to configure Fuel
for your particular networking environment,
while helping to detect errors early
so you do not need to troubleshoot individual configuration files.

.. note::  The VirtualBox automated scripts
   depend on the network configuration in the *config.sh* file
   so it can connect to the virtual nodes correctly.
   Do not use Fuel Setup to configure the Admin network interface
   when using VirtualBox,
   but you can view this Fuel Setup screen
   by modifying the `vm_master_ip` parameter in the *config.sh* file.

Use the arrow keys to navigate through the tool.
Once you have made your changes,
go to Save & Quit.

You can run "fuelmenu" from a root shell on the Fuel Master node
after deployment to make minor changes
to network interfaces, DNS, and the gateway.
The PXE settings, however,
cannot be changed after deployment as it will lead to deployment failure.

.. warning::

  Once IP settings are set at boot time for Fuel Master node,
  they **should not be changed during the entire lifecycle of Fuel.**
