Additional information
======================

If you have any questions about Fuel plugins, use the openstack-dev
mailing list (use the [fuel][plugins] prefix). For instructions on
the mailing list usage, see the
`openstack-dev <http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-dev>`_
mailing list instructions.

To file a defect for this document, do the following:

#. Go to the `Fuel Launchpad project <https://launchpad.net/fuel>`_.
#. Click :guilabel:`Report a bug.`
#. Put ``[SDK]`` in the :guilabel:`Summary` field and provide a summary
   of the defect.
#. Provide a detailed description of the defect in the ticket body.
#. Once you save the bug, tag it with ``area-docs``.

Use the same procedure to file a bug report for the Fuel plugin framework
itself, just use ``[Fuel plugins]`` instead of ``[SDK]`` in the
:guilabel:`Summary` field.
