Nailgun extension
-----------------

An isolated piece of code that you keep in a separate repository and
plug in and out. The Nailgun extension can introduce additional
API handlers, callbacks and embeds itself into the attributes serialization
pipeline.

You can use the extensions to integrate into the deployment pipeline
third-party services, such as LDAP or your own configuration management
database.
